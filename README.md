### Building a Task Tracker App with React.js

This is the product of a tutorial that I followed on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&t=1118s.

This is an applied step for me to learn and practice my HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React skills to further develop them. I hope to use these skills to help businesses and people in my future work.
